This is the assignment for week 3. The task was to create a web app either using Streamlit or Gradio that compares responses from 5+ different LLMs (open-source and API-based) to user queries, allowing side-by-side comparison of model outputs. I have used Gradio the code for which can be found on app.py. The enclosed .env file contains the API keys used.
